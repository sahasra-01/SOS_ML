Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in data sets, which differ from the norm. And anomaly detection is often applied to unlabeled data which is known as unsupervised anomaly detection. Anomaly detection has two basic assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Anomalies only occur very rarely in the data.
    \item Their features differ from the normal instances significantly.
\end{itemize}
