Machine Learning is undeniably one of the most influential and powerful technologies in todayâ€™s world. It is a tool for turning information into knowledge. In the past 50 years, there has been an explosion of data. This mass of data is useless unless we analyze it and find the patterns hidden within. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically find the valuable underlying patterns within complex data that we would otherwise struggle to discover. The hidden patterns and knowledge about a problem can be used to predict future events and perform all kinds of complex decision making.\\\\
There are multiple forms of Machine Learning; supervised, unsupervised , semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. Each form of Machine Learning has differing approaches, but they all follow the same underlying process and theory. I'll cover supervised and unsupervised learning for my report.


\section{Supervised and Unsupervised Learning}
  The most basic thing to remember is that we already know what our correct output should look like in Supervised Learning.
  But, we have little or no idea about what our results should look like.

  \textbf{Supervised Learning:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Classification: Spam/Not-spam. 
    \item Regression: Predicting age.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Unsupervised Learning:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Clustering: Grouping based on different variables.
    \item Non Clustering: Finding structure in a chaotic environment.
  \end{itemize}
